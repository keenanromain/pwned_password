# pwned_password

Run this script to see if a generated sha-1 of a password has appeared in a data breach. The query sends the first 5 characters of the hashed value to the haveibeenpwned.com database, so the request should be considered safe and anonymous, and the prompt for a password is not echoed to the terminal when typed. Be careful with your passwords on the internet.<br /><br />
