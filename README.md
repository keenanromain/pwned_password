# pwned_password

Run this script to see if a generated sha-1 of a password has appeared in a data breach. This script queries the first 5 characters of the hashed value to the haveibeenpwned.com database, so the request should be considered safe and anonymous. The prompt for a password to search does not echoe onto the screen during typing.<br /><br />
