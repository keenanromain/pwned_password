# pwned_password

Run this script to see if a generated sha-1 of a password has appeared in a data breach. The query sends the first 5 characters of the hashed value to the haveibeenpwned.com database, so the request should be considered safe and anonymous, and the user input is not echoed to the terminal when typed in.<br /><br />
To check if an email account is compromised, go to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned</a> for more info.
